# FriendFinder

Friend Finder is a match based website much like the many, well known dateing websites.  The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the use of Express.js, as well as using Heroku to deploy the application.

# Important Notes

The goal of this website was to meet all requirments needed to demonstrate proficiency with npm packages such as Express.  Other elements requiered were Bootstrap, limited Jquery for the match logic, as well as a snazzy theme (that was a personal requierment). The site was deployed on Heroku at https://nameless-basin-84194.herokuapp.com/.
